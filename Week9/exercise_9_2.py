Exercise 9.2: Pulling Data from APIs
Joshua Gardner
'''

'''
Complete the following using Python - make sure to show your work and show the values returned. YOu can submit via your
notebook or code editor, no need to export your work.

In this exercise, you will create a twitter account (if you don't already have one, or don't wish to use your personal
account) and practice pulling data from Twitter's publically available API. You can delete the twitter account as soon
as you have completed the exercise. Include your code and output for each step.
    1. Create a Twitter API Key and Access Token (Data Wrangling with Python, pg 365 - 366)
    2. Do a single data pull from Twitter's REST API (Data Wrangling with Python, pg 366 - 368)
    3. Execute multiple queries at a time from Twitter's REST API (Data Wrangling with Python, pg 368 - 371)
    4. Do a data pull from Twitter's Streaming API (Data Wrangling with Python, pg 372 - 374)

Part 1 - Create a Twitter API Key and Access Token (Data Wrangling with Python, pg 365 - 366)

The first step to working on this is that you need to have an account with Twitter. I don't want to use my personal
Twitter account for this yet, so I'm creating an account at https://twitter.com/signup.
